# Retrieve the number of starlink satellites deployed in each launch from the spacexapi using sql.

# Calculate the total number of starlink satellites currently in space by summing up the number of satellites deployed in each launch.

# Calculate the difference between the current number of starlink satellites and the target number of 42,000.

# Calculate the average number of starlink satellites deployed in each launch.

# Divide the difference by the average to get the number of launches required to reach the target of 42,000 starlink satellites.

# Retrieve the date of the most recent launch from the spacexapi using sql.

# Calculate the number of days between the most recent launch and the current date.

# Multiply the number of days by the number of launches required to reach the target, and add it to the date of the most recent launch to get the estimated date when spacex will reach 42,000 starlink satellites.
